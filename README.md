**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. The website is responsive: check out the mobile version. Also looks good on tablets (bot vertically and horizontally oriented), small screens, and even 4K displays.   

**Design**

**What's in the code**

The CSS is structured in line with BEM methodology. Particular emphasis is put on working with grid containers and minimizing the use of unnecessary divs (check out the Route 66 overlay).
